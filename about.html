<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello world! My name is Ester Covarrubias. I am 32 years old and I am Mexican-American. I currently live in France 
  with my husband. My first job in France was as an English trainer. I worked about 24 hours per week and I would either 
  go to my students' workplace or they would come see me at my office. My students were all much older than me. They were 
  professional in all different types of fields like in banking, the post office, museums and more. I would often have to
  put a timer to control my time with them because we would carry on talking and doing our coursework.</p>

<p>My second job in France was at a company called Ringover. They were a telecommunications company that was in VOIP which 
  means that everything was wireless. There was only a need to download an app and have good internet access. One thing I 
  liked was the fact that there were a lot of international people. However the majority were still French. We had a small
  tight knit group of colleagues that always had a good time. </p>

<p>My last and most recent job is at a company called Nosto. I have been here for about one year and a half. My job  
  has almost the same tasks as my pervious jobs, I manage clients accounts and help them with the time they stay with 
  Nosto. I have the best colleagues. We have a great team spirit and know how to have a really good time.</p>
